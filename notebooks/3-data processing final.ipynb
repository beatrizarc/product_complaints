      "On 28-09-2016 at 9:38 (PT time) I have sent a VERY URGENT document from CTT of Quarteira PT to Turin IT.\n",
      "According to your CTT Operator, the Delivery Service should be guaranteed within the next 24 hours, if and only if the destination in Italy would be a main city and not a little town or village. And I agreed with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now is 29-09-2016 at 17:30 (PT time) and your online Track & Trace tell me that the Code EE 22003912 5 PT is not arrived to the destination (even in Italy, I suppose).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me remind you that I have payed more than € 30 just to have a Service which is NOT guarantee.\n",
      "And I have just discovered from your Trak & Trace that my Envelope, with 09:38 (Aceitação), has been sent on 21:13 (Expedição). The receiver is on 29-09-2016 at 00:55 (Receção) - C.O. LOURES - MARL (WHERE?).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, I have few questions, as a Client/Customer of your service.\n",
      "1) Why an URGENT ENVELOP accepted on 9:38 by CTT as 24h delivery must be sent JUST ON 21:13?\n",
      "2) Why an ONLINE Track & Trace DOES NOT tell to the Client WHERE is WHO has in charge the envelop?\n",
      "3 Do I have to EXPECT (and hope) that my URGENT envelop will be ARRIVE at Turin IT this night at 21:13?\n",
      "4) Do I have to believe that YOUR LOCAL AGENCY (in Italy) will deliver my enevelop in 21:13 in Turin?\n",
      "5) Why you do not explain WHO IS and WHERE IS LOCATED the \"C.O. LOURES - MARL\" agency? PT? IT?\n",
      "\n",
      "IMHO, it is clear that CTT does not have the ability to send an envelop/pack within 24h in Europe efficiently.\n",
      "And we are talking about Portugal and Italy, two countries that belong to the Shengen european area.\n",
      "FOR SURE, next time I will use a private service which is able to deliver an envelop from PT to IT in 24h.\n",
      "I am sure that I will not pay more than € 30. Probably less than this. To have the QoS as expected.\n",

      "CTT received a parcel from the UK on 27 March 2021 which contained prescription medication. Onward delivery of the parcel to our address in Portugal was suspended pending a referral to INFARMED.  CTT confirmed this in a letter sent to us on 6 April 2021.  I emailed CTT immediately to explain the personal circumstances resulting in the medication being posted from the UK and that my partner has a rare medical condition which means this medication is critical for his health. I did not receive a reply to this email. I then contacted INFARMED directly myself to confirm their position on the medication being held at customs.  INFARMED emailed me on 16 April to confirm that the medication was 'exempt' from requiring their authorisation for delivery because a) they were satisfied the medication is prescription and came from a UK pharmacy b) they were satisfied the medication is for personal use, and c) they had taken into consideration the travel restrictions in place due to Covid-19 preventing us from getting this medication elsewhere.  Two copies of this email confirming INFARMED's decision was also sent to CTT yesterday   Today, I have checked the CTT Customer Portal to discover the status of the parcel is 'Return to Sender'.  I have tried to contact CTT numerous times this morning and spoken to call centre operators but after two failed attempts to speak to someone in the Complaints Department to explain the urgency of this situation, I have no option but to make a formal complaint publicly.  Please can CTT investigate this complaint and, more importantly, locate the two emails that were sent by INFARMED yesterday as I suspect the content of those emails has been misunderstood.  This has now created a real problem for my partner whose health could now seriously deteriorate without this critical medication.  Any help CTT can provide to retrieve this parcel and ensure delivery to our address in Portugal would be greatly appreciated.\r\n",

I ask CTT to give me refund for my parcle&#39;s value for 91EURs, but CTT tried every excuses to escape. First, said that they can not refund my loss of cost in complaints, then said only Japan can ask for refund. When I showed CTT with invoice and credit card records that I am the only one who paid for the parcel,not Japan and asking for the refund, CTT keep silence again! Now it has been 2 weeks since I sent them the proofs.

      "I have one parcel at CTT in Lisbon LZ194359415US. It is there from 14th of December 2016. On the 15th of January I sent all documentation and received a ticketno,  M13KJL. On the 27th of January I had tel. contact with No 707262626 and they told me that all was OK and I would receive my parcel. Today i phoned the same tel no and they told me that they are going to send my documentation to a department for reviewing my parcel. So in 14 days there was nothing done to send me my parcel which is in customs since the 14 th of December. As I ordered this foodsupplements the 30th of November 2016 the US supplier sent me a replacement because they thought this period of more than a month to get me a parcel was outrageous. So they sent me again a bottle of foodsupplements , parcelno LZ104357949US. This is miraculously in customs on Madeira. I sent the requiered documents to afuncha@at.gov.pt and asked for a confirmation of receipt of my email. I received nothing and it is still in customs Funchal. First I want to complain about the lying from your 707262626 employes because they told me the parcel was on its way and today i learned it is not on its way bu the documents are pnly sent today to get that far. Second I want to complain taht I do not know if the second requiered set of documents is received. I did not receive a ticket no etc etc. I want one of the parcels as quick as possible because I will run out of my nescessary foodsupplements shortly and you acnnot blame me for not ordering in time when the orde was placed on the 30 th of november and since 14 december the stuff is at the customs ddepartment of CTT.\n",

      "I paid for a service and the service was not correctly provided. They accepted a package with a wrong postal code in one of their offices and therefore it never arrived. They only realized there was a mistake on the postal code after 4 calls. They clearly have the means to notice if a postal code doesn't match with an address, so if they accepted the package anyway that means they were negligent, therefore it's seems to me that this is a scam. They charged me for a service they had the means to know it was going to be faulty. I demand my money back plus some kind of compensation because of all the grievances. It's been almost a month and this hasn't been resolved and I still have to waste my time having to remind you of this issue, plus I wasted two work days waiting for a package that you knew that was never going to come. That means I lost money and I think it's unfair that the company doesn't even reply back on time or try to fix their mistake. So far I'm the only one loosing here. Seeing the amount of complains this company has on this site, I think they have no moral authority to argue anything against cases like this. So I hope they come up with a solution that, for once,benefits me instead of their company's interests. \n",

This quote applies perfectly to Portugal in general and to CTT in particular! The problem with CTT is that they were a solid company, made a profit, had excellent service (&quot;the 2nd best in Europe&quot;), and of course, they had a banking license! ... Manuel Champalimaud, one of the rich in a poor Portugal took advantage that the country was on sale after the troika came to Portugal and put his hands on CTT! And so the second best postal service company became the worst, but made Manuel Champalimaud and Francisco Lacerda a little bit richer, in a poorer country but more richer! ... At this moment I believe that the CTT have already totally lost the shame of what they are doing, and they do not seem to care anymore to hide their mediocrity! ... After all, what is the priority of CTT? The quality of the service or the distribution of dividends by shareholders? Of course, it&#39;s the dividends to be distributed by shareholders! That&#39;s why we are a poor country that creates riches peoples! A country where misery coexists with paradisiacal landscapes! A country where CTT can have such a mediocre service that they lost 55% of my objects and nobody cares about why! ... At this moment the CTT have 4 objects of mine! And this situation happens after the CTT have lost 55% objects from a set of 22! So the question here is not knowing when the CTT intend to deliver my objects, but to know if the CTT intend to deliver my objects! So I put this new question to CTT, that is, considering that CTT do not have the capacity to provide universal postal services, they have some intention of giving me my objects in their entirety or will the delivery of my objects is not a priority, so they can not guarantee delivery? However, I would like CTT to respond to questions that have already been raised, but do not respond, such as the following; Why do CTTs lose between 40% and 50% of my orders and do not justify the phenomenon or correct it! Why is it that the CTT no longer give me letters? The CTT had a lost of my letters in the order of 90%, of course, when they gave me letters, they are no longer giving me letters, but I do not want to believe that they are losing 100% of the letters, some internal problem maibe needs to be solved, i want believe in this !\r\n",

It is obvious that Francisco Lacerda was a nightmare for CTT, and unfortunately I do not think Joao Bento is a better option, unfortunately it is what is available for Manuel Champalimaud, for that matter the question I put is the following; the CTT are waiting for Jo&atilde;o Bento to assume the presidency of CTT to return to fulfill the minimum services?\r\n",

      "When I think of CTT right now, the first image that comes to mind is Iwazaru, Kikazaru and Mizaru! Because ? Simple, CTT accept our letters, orders and money and then behave like these three characters ! How ? Simple again, what happens when the CTT accept our letters, orders and money, and then they just disappear with them? They just pretend that they said nothing, that they heard nothing and that they see nothing ! And so we ended up without our our letters, orders, money and of course, without any explanation of the CTT ! &hellip; How is this possible without consequences from ANACOM? Simple, Portugal is one of the most corrupt countries in Europe! This is hard to believe but it is a proven fact! Does this imply that the impunity of this CTT behavior is due to corruption? Personally I do not believe, on the other hand Portugal is an extremely conformist country, a perfect example of what a country is to literally live a kind of boil frog syndrome! That&#39;s why I&#39;m not surprised that the Portuguese population is one of the most antidepressants consumers in Europe! The problem of the CTT is the conformism of the Portuguese people, who protests to lose their most basic rights, their dignity, but that does not take any type of action! If there is any doubt about this, just see the documentary &quot;Donos de Portugal&quot; authored by Jorge Costa, read the book &quot;Privataria&quot;, and of course see the parliamentary hearing of Francisco Lacerda and Joe Berardo. If any doubts remain about the passivity of the Portuguese, then just listen to the words of the former head of the Italian mafia, that is, Emilio Di Giovine. The same affirms that Portugal is a beautiful country that people do not know to appreciate, is a country that is a Switzerland but poor, being that the fault is divided by few rich peoples because in Portugal the people could live much better, there is no justice because there is ignorant people, there is no instruction! This is the problem of the CTT, they think they are dealing with a passive and ignorant people because the passivity of the Portuguese people, they believe that they can take away our dignity without there being any consequence! They believe so much in this that they ended up putting this idea into practice, the problem is that in Portugal we are not all ignorant and much less passive when someone takes away our dignity, we can be few but I hope enough to show to ANACOM that we will not go conform to this situation! What do I want with this complaint? Simple, I want a set of 4 objects that are retained by CTT, and considering that I have previously reported the retention of a set of 22 objects and the loss of 12 of these objects I am afraid of not receiving these new 4 objects! These objects are as follows, 1&ordm; UR317461322CN 2&ordm; LP00132178470872 3&ordm; LP00132674998575 4&ordm; LP00133264032026 . What I want is simple, that they give me these four objects retained and that they answer the following questions to me; Why the CTT lose between 40% and 50% of my orders? Why do CTTs lose 90% of my letters? Why the CTT do not deliver me any kind of mail within two weeks when they have my orders retained? Why does not CTT have a free customer helpline?\r\n",

Where are my shoes? I have exchanged numerous communications (telephonically and via email) with CTT, but as at date hereof I have not received my shoes. I have complied with Customs requirements and provided all the required information and documentation and this has been verified and accepted. The tracking status has not been updated in weeks... As you can imagine I am outraged at this lengthy delay on the part of CTT, without any credible explanation. I need CTT to deliver my shoes urgently to my residence. It is almost two months since its arrival in Lisbon. Your poor service is unacceptable!\r\n",

      "We made an official request with CTT to hold our mail from 20 July until 10 August, 2018. On 10 August we picked up our mail from the office at Casal Ribeiro and assumed the hold would stop as requested. We do not receive a large amount of mail, so we did not suspect until the middle of September when two important pieces of mail had not been delivered that we were not receiving our mail. We went to the office at Casal Ribeiro on 19 September and 20 September to check if any mail was there being held for us. There was mail. On the 20th we asked specifically why our mail was still being held, although the stickers on the mail said hold until 10 August. The worker who helped us said he would request the hold be stopped. However, when my husband went on the 24th of September to check again if there was mail, he found more mail being held for him. Finally on 25th September we received mail at our building.\n",

On the 19th of September when I visited the Casal Ribeiro CTT office, the person who served me suggested the problem might have been that the address was written incorrectly on the letter. The next day I returned with a photo of the receipt from the US showing that the address is correct on the letter (also attached here). I requested to make a reclamation about this piece of mail because it was not held at Casal Ribeiro for me, and I received no information about any attempted deliveries of the letter and they were unable to tell me anything about where the letter was. They made a reclamation, but I cannot figure out how to access the information about the reclamation.\n",

When I look at the CTT registered mail tracking site, it looks as if an attempt to deliver the registered letter was made on 19 September (the day of my first visit to the post office asking about the letter), but I received no notice of this delivery attempt, and I was at the Casal Ribeiro office on both the 19th and the 20th asking about the letter and they were not able to tell me anything about it.

At the moment i have to refer to the 12 objects that were not delivered as lost objects, since after a long retention period, according to my experience with CTT, the probability of them delivering the remaining objects is minimal ! ... Regarding this issue, i am satisfied that the loss rates of CTT in relation to my international orders remain stable between 40% and 50% ... I consider this stability to be positive, although i consider negative the CTT&quot;s operational inability to reduce this percentage for a volume that does not cause as many problems as the cause at presente since i cannot fully accept that in this particular case, that 45% of my orders have been lost without any kind of justification by CTT, on the other hand, i am extremely grateful that the CTT delivered me 55% of the items on the list ! ... I would like the CTT to answer a number of questions, questions as following ; Why are the CTT losing 40% to 50% of my postal items ? Why do not the CTT justify why they do not deliver 40% to 50% of postal items ? Why do not CTT take responsability for losing this volume of objects? Why do i have to wait between 20/30 minutes to be serviced by an operator and pay 5&euro; or more when i use the CTT helpline ? Why the CTT lose 90% of my letters ? How can i be sure that my lost letters are not being delivered to aliatory dwellings as it already happened ?

      "According to tradition when the ship is sinking the captain is the last to abandon the ship, however it is obvious that in practice this is not what happens in reality, this was obvious with the case of Captain Francesco Schettino and more obvious now is with the CEO Francisco Lacerda!\r\n",
      "When we consider Francisco Lacerda&#39;s performance in CTT, we quickly came to the conclusion that it was an extremely mediocre performance. That is, if we analyze the time frame between 2013 and 2016, we see that 274,000,000 &euro; were distributed in dividends by the shareholders, which was withdrawn from the company, which in turn had net results lower than this value, and in one year in particular Francisco Lacerda even distributed 70,000,000 &euro; in dividends when CTT only had 60,000,000 &euro; profits!\r\n",
      "How can he do that? Simple, through the patrimonial delapidation of CTT, a company with 500 years of history in Portugal! However, the patrimony of the company are limited, so believe that if Francisco Lacerda will continue to distribute dividends to shareholders based on this delapidation, it has been a Chimera.\r\n",
      "What happened when Francisco Lacerda realized that he had to start making a profit with the CTT in order to distribute millionaire dividends? Simple, by Christmas 2018, he decided to announce that he would put into practice a restructuring plan for CTT, of course, a restructuring plan at this stage was not good news for anyone, neither for shareholders nor for workers, nor for the clients, so what did Francisco Lacerda do? Simple, he created an operational transformation plan that in the background was aimed at restructuring company!\r\n",
      "The key question that arises here is whether this operational transformation plan has resulted? The answer is obvious! Of course not ! With due respect, Francisco does not understand anything about the management of postal service companies, however partially Lacerda fulfilled the role that the Champalimaud wanted to fulfill, that is, to make a lot of money with CTT, however, when the money is gone and the company is in a chaos what does Lacerda do? Leave the ship ! After all, what is most important ? Institutional integrity ? The provision of a quality public servisse ? Of course not, the most important is money ! The Champalimaud won their money and Francisco Lacerda also, after all, with an salary of 925 404 &euro; for consecutive years, he has earned enough money to be able to retire now! Of course the Champalimaud want to continue to make money with the CTT, how are they going to do that, with Jo&atilde;o Bento ? Not even Rui Sinel de Cordes could make a better joke than this !\r\n",
      "The question I want to raise with this complaint is as follows, with the departure of Francisco Lacerda and the entrance of Jo&atilde;o Bento, the CTT will begin to fulfill the public service in the Azores and finally answer the questions placed to CTT, questions related to the serious deficiencies related to the CTT service in the Azores ? Or will they continue to deny that CTT are only providing the minimal services in a mediocre way? Denial is done through the deflection adopted by CTT officials responsible for responding to complaints? I will put again a set of questions that CTT officials have not yet responded by adopting a deflective behavior, of course with the hope that the same officials finally answer the tables questions. 1&ordm; Why are the CTT losing 40% to 50% of my postal items ? Why do not the CTT justify why they do not deliver 40% to 50% of postal items ? Why do not CTT take responsability for losing this volume of objects? Why do i have to wait between 20/30 minutes to be serviced by an operator and pay 5&euro; or more when i use the CTT helpline ? Why the CTT lose 90% of my letters ? How can i be sure that my lost letters are not being delivered to aliatory dwellings as it already happened ? Again I wait patiently for your answers, greetings.\r\n",
